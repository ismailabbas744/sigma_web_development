        aspect ratio but in this some part of image may be cut off or crop</p>
    <p><b>object-fit: contain</b> // this means that the image does not lose its aspect ratio but may be some part of
        the width and height is left empty</p>
    <p><b>object-position: top right </b>// this is used when some part of image is cut during object-fit: cover so if
        we want some specific part of the image that is more important or for any reason then we have to use this or
        something like bottom left or center center or top left etc</p>
